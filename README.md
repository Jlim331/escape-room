# escape-room

Python game based on the escape room game concept.

You are spawned in a room where you have to find three keys hidden in the room
before turn 90 or else you lose. Each tile has a unique description and along with it
some unique options. Certain events trigger when you choose different actions.

something fun to play with, and with that being said good luck and have fun with Escape Room
